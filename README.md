# Cloud-Security-Learning
Learning project & experiments in Cloud Security and DevSecOps
I’m a Junior Digital Transformation Coordinator with a background in System & Network Administration.  
I’m currently building my expertise in **Cloud Security** and plan to expand into **DevSecOps**.

This repository will host my learning projects, experiments, and notes as I grow my skills.  
Projects will be added soon!
